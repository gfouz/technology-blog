## [Technology blog.](https://github.com/gfouz)

This blog is about latest web innovations. And this blog
itself is built with Next.Js using the app directory
and server components, a new type of React components that
run on the server and return compiled JSX that is sent to
the client. Server Components are useful for rendering
the skeleton of a page, fetching data from the server in parallel,
and passing it to the "client components".
