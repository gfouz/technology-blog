## Finances tracker.

Finances tracker is a dynamic UI that is built with [Next.Js](https://nextjs.org/) and
[Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) to create a global
state for managing and persisting data within its
components that can capture and respond to user input, such as clicks,
keyboard events, and form submissions. Global state can change over
time and impact how the components appears or behaves during their life
cycle.
