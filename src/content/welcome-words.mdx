## Welcome to my blog.

Welcome to this [blog](https://github.com/gfouz). I'm excited to share my learning,
and what i have found interesting about web technology. I write about React, NextJs
TypeScript and JavaScript ecosystem. Always opened to learning new things and languages.
Learning and knowledge is bound to perseverance and to keep moving forward step by step.
So if you can´t fly then run, or can´t run then walk, or can´t walk then crawl, that means 
perseverance.
