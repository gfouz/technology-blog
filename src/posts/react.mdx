## React Server Components: Embrace the Future of Web Development

React Server Components (RSC) have burst onto the web development scene, offering a new and exciting way to build modern, efficient, and scalable applications. This innovation seeks to address the limitations of traditional client-side rendering, paving the way for a more performant and dynamic user experience.

## A new type of component introduced by the React team

React Server Components are a new type of component introduced by the React team, enabling developers to build modern user interfaces with server rendering capabilities. They provide a seamless blend of server-side and client-side rendering, allowing developers to render parts of their application on the server while maintaining the interactivity of a client-side app.

## React Server Components differ from traditional React components in that they:

1- Do not have client-side effects or event handlers
2- Can access server-side data sources directly
3- Render to HTML, not the DOM

This hybrid approach enables you to benefit from both worlds — the performance advantages of server-side rendering and the dynamic capabilities of client-side rendering.

## Advantages of React Server Components

One of the most significant benefits of RSC is its potential for improved performance. By rendering components on the server, you can minimize the amount of JavaScript and data sent to the client. This reduces the time for the initial page load and speeds up interactions, leading to a more responsive and enjoyable user experience.

React Server Components become an interesting concept. React Server Components allow us to completely offload individual components, along with their dependencies, to the server. This means they no longer run in the browser, and that means the amount of JavaScript that needs to be downloaded (and executed) shrinks. In Facebook’s initial experiments in a production environment, React Server Components resulted in a 29 percent smaller bundle size, or nearly a third, according to Facebook’s video presentation on React Server Components [1]. And that’s just the beginning.

## Backend access

Another benefit of RSC is that it can access backend resources directly from the server. This simplifies data fetching and eliminates the need for client-side state management.
Server components can use any Node.js API or library to fetch data from various sources, such as databases, file systems, caches, etc. They can also use GraphQL queries or REST endpoints to communicate with other services or APIs. Server components can pass the fetched data as props to other components in the tree, either server components or shared components.
This means that you do not need to write any code to fetch data on the client side, such as using hooks, custom hooks, reducers, actions, sagas, thunks, etc. You also do not need to worry about caching, invalidating, updating, or synchronizing the data between the server and the client.

## Zero Bundle Size Server Components

One of the main benefits of RSC is that they do not add any JavaScript code to your bundle size. This means that you can write as many server components as you want without worrying about the impact on your performance budget.

Server components are only executed on the server and never sent to the browser. The browser only receives the SCTF and the HTML that is generated by the server components. The browser does not need to know anything about the implementation details of the server components, such as their imports, dependencies, or logic.

This also means that you can use any Node.js library or API in your server components without having to install or configure any bundler or transpiler. You can also use modern JavaScript features such as ES modules, optional chaining, nullish coalescing, etc. without worrying about browser compatibility.

## Conclusion and outlook

React Server Components are a feature that allows developers to build highly performant React applications with zero bundle size and direct backend access. RSC are rendered on the server and stream HTML to the browser without sending any JavaScript code. RSC can also access backend resources directly from the server without requiring any client-side state management. RSC can seamlessly integrate with existing client-side React components and preserve the rich interactivity and flexibility of React.

Basically, of course, this is not a revolutionary new development. Many of the “advantages” gained through Server Components are inherent in a traditional web application without JavaScript in the browser. Facebook also explicitly says that they have been inspired by such traditional web architectures. Nevertheless – React Server Components allow us to get the best of both worlds. That’s why I’m very excited to experience React Server Components in a real application sometime in the future.
